# SimpleDb
Library for handling file-based and MSSQL-based databases.

## The SimpleDb
This library contains shared code used by the SimpleDbFiles and the SimpleDbMssql projects.
You have to use this library, if you want to use mentiones libraries.

## The SimpleDbFiles
Backed for the SimpleDb library. Uses files in the file system to store data. Each table
(data object) is stored in a separate directory. Each item of that table is stored in a 
separate file in that directory. Each data object using this library has to have the Id
column, because it is used to generate names for stored items.

This library is best for very simple and small databases.

## The SimpleDbMssql
Backed for the SimpleDb library. Uses MSSQL for storing data. 

This library is best for more complicated stuff.
